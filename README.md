# Random Number Calculator ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯

This is my first Flutter project in a while, and I used it to get back into the basics of Flutter - widgets , state, styling, etc. As such, it is a basic project, and the code is also very simple.

How it works is that there is a button that generates a random number between 1-1000. Below that is a set of 6 buttons. One to:

<ul>
  <li>Add 1 (+)</li>
  <li>Subtract 1 (-)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 2 (x)</li>
  <li>Divide by 2 (Ã·)</li>
  <li>Sqaure the number (xÂ²)</li>
  <li>Take the square root (âˆš)</li>  
</ul>

It then displays this calculation below it.
